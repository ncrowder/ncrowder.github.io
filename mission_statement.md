*My mission is to use data analytics to make sense of the world and to help others do the same!*

What this means:
- The world can be messy.  Data helps us cut through some of the subjective noise and all start from a common baseline.
- I enjoy using my skills to help small businesses and non-profits who lack experience or the resources to leverage data on their own.
- Always both a mentor and mentee, I aim to pass on what I know to others while continually adding to my own level of knowledge and understanding.
