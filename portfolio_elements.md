Here are a suggested list of things you may want to include on your page.  The things which have an \* beside them are required.  This list may evolve or change over time.

- \* Mission statement (the "why" behind what you're doing) with a list of your short and long term goals underneath.  
- \* Education, including any formal education such as community college or university as well as a list of continuing ed classes such as those you are taking on Datacamp.  
- \* Job history (keep it short, just title, place, years) with optional list of top work accomplishements (This should not take the place of your full detailed resume listing responsibilities or duties, etc.)
- \* Links to all completed projects or examples of work (artifacts) that highlight your skills and abilities.  You will be including a link to at least one aftifact created from each course in the ITDA program.
- \* Link to complete resume/CV
- Current interests and potential future projects you see yourself working on (i.e., open questions you would like to collect data and research to answer)
- List of skills/technologies you've used or worked with along with a rating on a scale of 1-4 of your confidence (1 = exposure, 2 = novice, 3 = proficient, 4 = expert).  If listing a specific program, like Excel, you may also highlight a few specific functions or tools within the program that you think may set you apart.  But keep it short.
- Any certifications (like Data+)
- Link to Medium blog (this may become required in the future)
- Endorsements i.e., see if someone would offer you a couple sentences on your abilities, skills, and impact within your current or a prior role and allow you to use their name and position (as your supervisor or boss)
